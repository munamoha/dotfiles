# dotfiles
dotfiles for my EndeavourOS i3 setup.

keep in mind that this is running alongside kde plasma, though this will mainly apply to spectacle, the screenshooter, which can be replaced.

The rofi theme comes from [rofi-themes-collection](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection) specifically DarkBlue by Qball.

Wallpaper is Haruka Kiritani's "You Deserve It" card from Project Sekai: Colorful Stage.

Plasma is still installed here so I use SDDM and mapped Spectacle to my screenshot button. 

As well, download [rofi-bluetooth](https://github.com/nickclyde/rofi-bluetooth/tree/master) for my polybar config if you would like, from the AUR or from the git repo if you are not on an Arch-based distribution.
